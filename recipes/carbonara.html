        <h3>Ingredients for two people:</h3>
            <p>Everything can be usually be found at grocery stores. Pecorino and Guanciale might be a bit harder to get depending on where you live, good replacements listed in the ingredients.</p>
        <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1 Tbsp of Olive oil:</strong> Ever present in Italian cuisine. Any will do, we just need it for the Guanciale.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>200g of Pasta:</strong> You can use long pasta like spaghetti or linguine, or any short format pasta.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>100g of Guanciale:</strong> Cured pork with a very distinct fat layer. Can be replaced with unsmoked Pancetta.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>2-3 Eggs:</strong> This will make the pasta super creamy when mixed with your cheese.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>15g of Pecorino:</strong> Delicious and salty Roman hard cheese. Can be replaced with Parmigiano which is easier to find.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li><strong>Ground pepper to taste:</strong> Can't go wrong with this. Freshly ground is preferred to get more aroma.</li>
                 </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>How to make it</h3>
            <p>This crazy good pasta is also incredibly easy to make. You just lightly fry your Guanciale with a tablespoon of Oilve oil while boiling your pasta in salted water. Whisk the eggs with your cheese, a pinch of salt and pepper. When your guanciale is ready ang slightly golden, turn off the heat and set the pan aside. Drain your pasta but keep a small cup of pasta water. Mix your pasta and Guanciale, then pour your egg and cheese mixture into the pan with some leftover pasta water and mix and toss everything together. I usually turn on the heat on medium-low to gently cook the egg mixture to my preferred creaminess. Just remember to keep mixing and stirring so that you don't overcook the eggs! At last, bomb the thing with ground black pepper. Or don't, but do put at least a few pinches.</p>
        <h4>Step by step:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by setting a pot of water to boil and a pan on medium heat.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>While your pan gets to proper temperature, cut your Guanciale into small strips.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Now that your pan is hot, pour a tablespoon of olive oil and throw the Guanciale in. You want to lightly fry until slightly golden. Kill the heat and set aside. </li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Your water should be boiling now. Just salt the pot with 1 and 1/2 tsp of salt and drop in your pasta.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>While waiting for the pasta to cook, you can prepare the egg and cheese mixture that we will add at the end. Whisk the eggs and grated cheese in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>When your pasta is done, keep a small cup of pasta water and drain the pot.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Mix your pasta in your pan with the fried Guanciale. Mix thoroughly.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Turn on heat on low.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Pour in your egg and cheese mixture with some leftover pasta water and keep mixing to gently cook the eggs. You can turn the heat to medium-low to make it faster, but be sure to never stop mixing or you'll get scrambled eggs instead.</li>
                        <br>
                    <li>Keep stirring to preferred creaminess. When done, touch up with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                        <br>   
                </ol>
            <p>And that's it really. Serve and eat. Super easy.</p>
